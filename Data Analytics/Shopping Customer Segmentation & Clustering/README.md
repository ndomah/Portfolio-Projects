# Shopping Customer Segmentation & Clustering
## Tools Used:
- Jupyter Notebook
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
## Description:
- Applied unsupervised machine learning techniques to segment customers by shopping behavior and demographics, enhancing targeting precision for marketing initiatives.
- Conducted comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset comprising 200 customers, incorporating univariate and bivariate analyses along with diverse visualization methods such as distribution plots, kernel density estimation (KDE) plots, box plots, scatter plots, pair plots, and correlation matrices.
- Employed clustering algorithms to identify distinct customer segments, ultimately establishing five clusters based on spending score and annual income for both male and female demographics.
