# IBM Capstone - Predicting SpaceX's Falcon 9 First Stage Success 
## Tools Used:
- Jupyter Notebook
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Folium
- Plotly Dash
- BeautifulSoup
- APIs
- Machine Learning (Classification)
- SQL
- Microsoft PowerPoint
## Description:
- Developed a predictive model to determine the success of Falcon 9 first stage landings, utilizing over 1,000 data points collected via SpaceX Rest API and web scraping from Wikipedia, and performed extensive data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), interactive visual analytics, and predictive analysis.
- Conducted EDA using SQL and visualization tools, including 6 different graphs, to identify key factors influencing rocket landing success and correlations between 10+ variables.
- Integrated Folium and Plotly Dash for interactive visual analytics, and implemented and fine tuned 5 classification models achieving a predictive accuracy of 83% for landing success rates.
