# Software Developer Salary Prediction
## Tools Used:
- Jupyter Notebook
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Machine Learning (Regression Model)
- Hyperparameter Tuning
- Pickle
- Streamlit
## Description:
- Analyzed Stack Overflow's 2020 Annual Developer Survey data from nearly 65,000 developers to build and evaluate 3 regression models, successfully predicting developer salaries based on country of residence, education level, and years of experience.
- Performed hyperparameter tuning on regression models, reducing error by 10%, and exported the best model as a pickle file for seamless integration into a web app.
- Developed a Streamlit web app with 2 interactive pages: 1 for salary prediction based on user input, and another featuring visual data exploration with pie, bar, and line charts to analyze developer demographics and salary trends for over 5 variables.
