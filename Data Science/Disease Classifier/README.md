## Description:
- Trained a TensorFlow model on over 4,000 images of tomato plant leaves across 3 classes (healthy, early blight, late blight), achieving 97.66% accuracy on the test dataset.
- Implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with layers for resizing, normalization (0 to 1), and data augmentation, using the Adam
optimizer and Sparse Categorical Crossentropy loss function.
- Enhanced model performance through preprocessing techniques and plotted accuracy and loss curves, demonstrating the model's effectiveness and robustness.
